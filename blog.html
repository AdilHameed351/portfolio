                    <br>
                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup
                        language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link
                        between web pages.</p>
                    <div class="blogItemBottom blogItemBottom1">
                        <br>
                        <p>A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the
                            structure
                            of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a
                            machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML)
                            are
                            human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the
                            text.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content,
                            in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
                            The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0,
                            published in 1995.</p>

                    <h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to
                        simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web
                        pages.</p>
                    <div class="blogItemBottom blogItemBottom2">
                        <br>
                        <p>More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web
                            page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and
                            much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers
                            and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides
                            powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled
                        programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known
                        for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.</p>
                    <div class="blogItemBottom blogItemBottom3">
                        <br>
                        <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for
                            Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an
                            imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of
                            objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators,
                            control structures, and statements.

                        <p>Originally run on the client-side, the JavaScript implementation has branched out to the
                            server-side after the Node.js development â€’ a cross-platform server environment built on the
                            Google Chrome JavaScript V8 engine.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end
                        web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
                        typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>
                    <div class="blogItemBottom blogItemBottom4">
                        <br>
                        <p>Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the
                            most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced
                            framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter
                            held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped
                            in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools
                            development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so
                            today.</p>

                    <h2>Website Development</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Web development is the act of building, creating and maintaining websites. The field encompasses
                        a
                        broad range of tasks including everything from coding, to technical design, to the performance
                        of a website or application running on the internet. Web development consists of front-end and
                        back-end components.</p>
                    <div class="blogItemBottom blogItemBottom5">
                        <br>
                        <p>There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.

                            Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work
                            itself is often broken down into three types.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact
                            with: the user interface (UI). Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and
                            JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look
                            and feel of the site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device
                            types.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Back-end development is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see.
                            This is also known as
                            server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes
                            logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Full-stack development is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the
                            site or app take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically
                            performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end
                            developers.</p>
